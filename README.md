# Rust-Documentation
It is a very low level programming language (system level programming language) like C,C++. It focuses on safety , speed, and concurrency. And it has a design that lets you create programs that have high performance but it also has a huge level of control and has the power of some of the high level language abstractions that we don't get in any other low level languages like C++ and C.Rust doesn't have garbage collection instead it uses something called Ownership.

##Installation
To install rust on your computer just go to https://www.rust-lang.org/
And then install the Rustup program which is the tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of Rust on your computer, stable build and development build. All three builds gets installed on your computer at once without having any issues.
With RustUp you get the rust compiler which is called Rust C and you also gain access to the Rust package manager which is called cargo.
